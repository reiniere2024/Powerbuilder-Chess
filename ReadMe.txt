Hi All,

This is a small Chess program that I made long ago in the Powerbuilder 6.5 program
made in 1997. As you can see its is still quite powerfull and in those days it was the
leading software platform before .NET and Java came.

At the moment Powerbuilder still exists. It went from Powersoft to Sybase, after that
to SAP and from SAP now to Appeon. Occasionally I still make software in PB and then
I still use PB6.5, because it is definitely the best version, and afterwards I port
the program then to the necessary Powerbuilder version.

Don't expect to much about the Chess capabilities of the black AI player. The program
is more a demonstation about the capabilities of the Powerbuilder 6.5 program.
I have included the full source code for people who also want to do some coding.

Good luck,
Reiniere.
